     *     to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.
     * <li>The <code>src</code> argument refers to an array with a primitive
     *    component type and the <code>dest</code> argument refers to an array
     *     with a reference component type.

     *     with a primitive component type.

     * <ul>
     * <li>The <code>srcPos</code> argument is negative.
     * <li>The <code>destPos</code> argument is negative.

     * type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an
