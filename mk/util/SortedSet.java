/**
 * A {@link Set} that further provides a <i>total ordering</i> on its elements.
 * The elements are ordered by a {@link Comparator} provided at sorted
 * set creation time.  The set's iterator will traverse the set in
 * ascending element order. Several additional operations are provided
 * to take advantage of the ordering.  (This interface is the set
 * analogue of {@link SortedMap}.)
 *
 * <p>All elements inserted into a sorted set must be supported by the specified comparator).
 * Furthermore, all such elements must be <i>mutually comparable</i>:
 * <tt>comparator.compare(e1, e2)</tt> must not throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in
 * the sorted set.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.
 *
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if
 * the sorted set is to correctly implement the <tt>Set</tt> interface.  (See
 * <tt>Comparator</tt> class for a
 * precise definition of <i>consistent with equals</i>.)  This is so because
 * the <tt>Set</tt> interface is defined in terms of the <tt>equals</tt>
 * operation, but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its
 * <tt>compare</tt> method, so two elements that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set,
 * equal.  The behavior of a sorted set <i>is</i> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the <tt>Set</tt> interface.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose sorted set implementation classes should
 * provide two "standard" constructors: 1) A constructor with an
 * argument of type <tt>Comparator</tt>, which creates an empty
 * sorted set sorted according to the specified comparator.
 * 2) A constructor with an argument of type <tt>SortedSet</tt>,
 * which creates a new sorted set with the same elements and the same
 * ordering as the input sorted set, along with Equality for
 * keys argument for both.  There is no way to enforce this
 * recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.
 *
 * <p>Note: several methods return subsets with restricted ranges.
 * Such ranges are <i>half-open</i>, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).
 * If you need a <i>closed range</i> (which includes both endpoints), and
 * the element type allows for calculation of the successor of a given
 * value, merely request the subrange from <tt>lowEndpoint</tt> to
 * <tt>successor(highEndpoint)</tt>.  For example, suppose that <tt>s</tt>
 * is a sorted set of strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the strings in <tt>s</tt> from <tt>low</tt> to
 * <tt>high</tt>, inclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sub = s.subSet(low, high+"\0");</pre>
 *
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an <i>open range</i> (which
 * contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the Strings in <tt>s</tt> from <tt>low</tt> to
 * <tt>high</tt>, exclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sub = s.subSet(low+"\0", high);</pre>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements maintained by this set
