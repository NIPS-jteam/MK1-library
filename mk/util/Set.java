/**
 * A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, sets
 * contain no pair of elements {@code e1} and {@code e2} such that
 * {@code getEquality().equals(e1, e2)}, and at most one null element.  As implied by
 * its name, this interface models the mathematical <i>set</i> abstraction.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Set} interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * inherited from the {@code Collection} interface, on the contracts of all
 * constructors and on the contracts of the {@code add}, {@code equals} and
 * {@code hashCode} methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
 * declarations have been tailored to the {@code Set} interface, but they do
 * not contain any additional stipulations.)
 *
 * <p>The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).
 *
 * <p>Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects {@code equals} comparisons while the
 * object is an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is
 * that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
 *
 * <p>Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
