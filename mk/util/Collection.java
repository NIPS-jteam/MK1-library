/**
 * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>.  A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>.  Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered
 * and others unordered.  The JDK does not provide any <i>direct</i>
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific subinterfaces like <tt>Set</tt> and <tt>List</tt>.  This interface
 * is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * <p><i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose <tt>Collection</tt> implementation classes (which
 * typically implement <tt>Collection</tt> indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type <tt>Collection</tt>, which
 * creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument.  In
 * effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
 * There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors) but all of the general-purpose <tt>Collection</tt>
 * implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 *
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to
 * throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if this collection does not
 * support the operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
 * required to, throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the
 * invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For example, invoking
 * the {@link #addAll(Collection)} method on an unmodifiable collection may,
 * but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added
 * is empty.
 *
 * <p><a name="optional-restrictions">
 * Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.</a>  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization
 * policy.  In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the
 * implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation
 * of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to
 * a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing
 * iterator to examine the collection.
 *
 * <p>Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in
 * terms of the equals method. For example, the specification for the
 * contains(E o) method says: "returns <tt>true</tt> if and only
 * if this collection contains at least one element <tt>e</tt> such that
 * <tt>(o==null ? e==null : getEquality().equals(o, e))</tt>."
 * This specification should
 * <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking <tt>Collection.contains</tt>
 * with a non-null argument <tt>o</tt> will cause <tt>getEquality().equals(o, e)</tt> to be
 * invoked for any element <tt>e</tt>.
 * This library of collections uses {@link Equality#equals(E, E) equals}
 * for the purpose.
 *
 * <p>Some collection operations which perform recursive traversal of the
 * collection may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where
 * the collection directly or indirectly contains itself.
 * Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario,
 * however most current implementations do not do so.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * The default method implementations (inherited or otherwise) do not apply any
 * synchronization protocol.  If a {@code Collection} implementation has a
 * specific synchronization protocol, then it must override default
 * implementations to apply that protocol.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements in this collection
